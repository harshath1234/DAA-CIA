PRIMS ALGORITHM 

generally prims algorithm cannot be used to solve directed graphs to find the MST. However in this problem scenario the prims algorithm proves to be effective in 
finding the MST and evaluating the cost.

KRUSKALS ALGORTIHM

For each step in kruskals algorithm we check if the minimum spanning forms a cycle or not. 
in directed graph only closed loops are said to form cycles but the kruskals algorithm assumes the MST to form cycles even if the loops arenâ€™t closed.

DIJSKSTRAS ALGORITHM 

this algorithm will not work for graphs having negative weights. Other ways to solve this problem is to use the Belman Ford's algorithm.
